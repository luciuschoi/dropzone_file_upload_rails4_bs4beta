# File Upload Example using Dropzone.js

http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2015/02/10/ruby-on-rails-uploads-multiple-files-with-dropzonejs-and-paperclip-gem/

This example source was written for demonstrating file upload using dropzone.js in Rails 4 according to the above link blog.

In the master branch, paperclip gem was used like the above blog, while, in the carrierwave branch, codes were rewritten using carrierwave gem.

Each example in the master and carrierwave branches works well.

I wish it would help you implement the file upload functionality in Rails 4.

And also, Bootstrap 4 beta version was included in Gemfile.
